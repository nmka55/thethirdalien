Welcome to The Third Alien - MP3 Tagger with iTunes Library search
===================
![HeaderImage](front.gif "HeaderImage")
The Third Alien (i know, the name doesn't make any sense, it sounded cool at the moment so I went with it.) is a Windows desktop program which tags mp3 files.

> Features:
> - Clear tags from file
> - Search by keywords from iTunes library and automatically insert basic tags(title, artist name, album name, album artwork) to file
